## PROBLEM STATEMENT:

You have to design a REST interface for a movie theatre ticket booking system. It should
support the following business cases:

● An endpoint to book a ticket using a user’s name, phone number, and timings.

● An endpoint to update a ticket timing.

● An endpoint to view all the tickets for a particular time.

● An endpoint to delete a particular ticket.

● An endpoint to view the user’s details based on the ticket id.

● Mark a ticket as expired if there is a diff of 8 hours between the ticket timing and current
time.

● Note: For a particular timing, a maximum of 20 tickets can be booked.

● You should follow the REST paradigm while building your application.

● You can use any database you like.

● Create a proper readme for your project.

● Plus point if you could delete all the tickets which are expired automatically.

● Plus point if you could write the tests for all the endpoints.

● Please attach a screenshot of your postman while testing your application.

● Please avoid plagiarism.
